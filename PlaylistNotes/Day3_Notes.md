# Day 3 - Network Fundamentals
 Date:July 16, 2025

## What I Studied:  
Continued tryhackme next module- Networking fundamentals which included:
  - What is Networking?
  - What is Internet?   
  - Different types of ways to identify devices on network. 
  - What is IP address?
  - What is difference between IPv4 vs IPv6.
  - What is Ping?

## What I Practiced or Explored:  
- Researched examples of ways on how ip address are identified.  
- Took notes on the fundamentals and how to servers actually are connected.  

## What I Learned:  
- What is a network: Communication of devices through data with each other while human beings communicate with each other.
- Internet: The internet is a network of networks which are both public networks and private networks.
- IP Address: The IP address is like the name of the device for a short period of time and can be a public IP address (accessible from the Internet) and/or a private IP address (only on local network).
- MAC Address: The MAC address is a hardware address for a device that is a unique, lifelong identifier on the network for that device, much like your fingerprint.
- IPv4 vs IPv6: IPv4 only has approximately 4 billion addresses whereas IPv6 addresses exceed trillions of addresses.
- Ping & ICMP: Tools that works together to verify devices that can connect.
- MAC Spoofing: Changing the MAC address on a device to avoid restrictions on the network (popular practice on public Wi-Fi).

## What Was Difficult or Needs More Study:  
- MAC spoofing how it works if traffic is high.

## Next Steps:
