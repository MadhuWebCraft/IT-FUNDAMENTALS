### What I Studied
- Explored wired and wireless options for connecting smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices to computers and networks.
- Covered USB standards: Micro-USB, Mini-USB, USB Type-A, USB-C.
- Learned about proprietary connectors, such as Apple Lightning.
- Wireless options include NFC, Bluetooth, tethering, and mobile hotspots.

### What I Practiced or Explored
- Compared USB connector types and identified which devices use what plugs.
- Reviewed how tethering and hotspots work and the differences in functionality.
- Looked into built-in wireless methods (Bluetooth/NFC) for payments, identification, and connectivity.

### What I Learned
- USB-C is quickly becoming the default due to:
  - Reversible design
  - Higher speeds
  - Support for video, charging, and data
- Lightning Cable (Apple):
  - 8 pins, reversible, higher charging power
- NFC is short-range and secure, used for payments, access control, and file transfers.
- Bluetooth is used for headsets, mice, keyboards, and file sharing.
- Tethering connects one device, while a hotspot allows sharing with many devices.

### What Was Difficult or Needs More Study
- Understanding all USB generations and their speed and power limits.
- More hands-on practice with NFC use cases and hotspot carrier limitations.

### Next Steps
- Test USB-C and Lightning cables with different devices.
- Try enabling and disabling the personal hotspot and NFC features on my phone.
- Learn more about the compatibility of NFC between Android and iOS.




## Topic 2: Mobile and Laptop Peripheral Devices

### What I Studied
- Common external accessories and connectivity options:
  - Stylus, headsets, speakers, webcams, docking stations, trackpads, and drawing tablets
- Explored wired and wireless connections such as TRRS, Bluetooth, USB, and Lightning.

### What I Practiced or Explored
- Recognized audio jack types (TRRS: Tip Ring Ring Sleeve).
- Tested the functionality differences between wired and Bluetooth audio.
- Explored how docking stations and port replicators expand laptop I/O options.

### What I Learned
- Stylus: A wireless (Bluetooth) input device, pressure-sensitive, and must be compatible with the device (e.g., Apple Pencil).
- Headsets:
  - Wired: USB, TRRS, Lightning
  - Wireless: Battery-powered Bluetooth
- Speakers: Bluetooth speakers typically offer better sound than built-in speakers.
- Webcams: Connect via USB or are built-in for video conferencing use.
- Docking Station: Designed for office use, plugs into multiple ports, and adds card and support functionality.
- Port Replicator: Lightweight and USB-powered, allows additional ports (video, USB, SD).
- Trackpads and Drawing Tablets:
  - Stylus-supported for creative input
  - Desktop trackpads available for gestures and mouse alternative functions

### What Was Difficult or Needs More Study
- Using a drawing pad on desktops
- Identifying which trackpad gestures and stylus shortcuts work on different operating systems and devices
- Configuring TRRS for microphones

### Next Steps
- Practice setting up an external webcam and stylus device.
- Try different port replicators with my laptop.
- Study function keys for enabling and disabling trackpads.




## Topic 3: Laptop Hardware Fundamentals

### What I Studied
- Internal laptop components include batteries, memory (SO-DIMM), hard drives (HDD/SSD), keyboards, and wireless cards.
- Differences between modular and built-in parts.
- Upgrading and replacing components.
- Data migration techniques such as imaging and cloning.

### What I Practiced or Explored
- Reviewed SO-DIMM and M.2 form factors and how SSDs compare to traditional spinning drives.
- Identified what makes laptop disassembly easier or harder.
- Explored imaging methods for migrating data from HDD to SSD.

### What I Learned
- Batteries:
  - Two types: Lithium-Ion and Li-Ion Polymer
  - Modular batteries are easily swappable; built-in batteries require opening the device
- Memory:
  - Laptops use SO-DIMM.
  - Some systems have non-upgradable soldered RAM.
- Storage:
  - Older systems use 2.5" HDD.
  - Newer systems use M.2 SSD – smaller, faster, and simpler.
- Cloning software simplifies data transfer when upgrading to SSD.
- Wireless Cards:
  - Detachable (Mini PCIe) or built-in.
  - Antennas are often wired through the laptop display.
- Keyboard Replacement:
  - Common repairs due to wear.
  - Usually done with ribbon cables and access bezels.
  - External USB keyboards help with troubleshooting.

### What Was Difficult or Needs More Study
- Differences between M.2 NVMe and M.2 SATA.
- Disassembly techniques specific to different laptop brands.
- Software options for easily cloning SSDs.

### Next Steps
- Practice replacing storage devices using M.2 and 2.5" SSDs.
- Compare features of cloning software, such as Macrium Reflect and Clonezilla.
- Disassemble an old laptop: remove the battery, check the memory and stora
