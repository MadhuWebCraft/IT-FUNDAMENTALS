 Date:July 12, 2025

## What I Studied:  
Watched Simplilearn’s "Introduction to Cyber Security" video (38 minutes).  
- Covered basics like:  
  - What is cybersecurity?  
  - Why cybersecurity is important.  
  - How cybersecurity works (principles like CIA triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
  - Different types of hackers and common attacks in cybersecurity. 
  - Roles of cybersecurity experts.  
  - Overview of certifications required.

## What I Practiced or Explored:  
- Researched examples of common cyber threats: malware, phishing, ransomware.  
- Took notes on the CIA triad and its importance in protecting data.  
- Reflected on real-world cyber attack scenarios mentioned (e.g., data breach at a company).

## What I Learned:  
- Cybersecurity is all about protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or damage.  
- The CIA triad is fundamental:  
  - Confidentiality: Only authorized access.  
  - Integrity:Data must not be altered improperly.  
  - Availability: Data and systems must be available when needed.  
- Cybercrimes include computer-assisted crimes, attacks targeting computers, and crimes where computers are incidental.  
- Importance of proactive security measures, like blocking harmful websites and user awareness.

## What Was Difficult or Needs More Study:  
- Understanding types of cybercrime in detail (e.g., difference between "computer-assisted crime" and "computer as a target").  
- The full range of cybersecurity certifications and which one to pursue first.

## Next Steps:
